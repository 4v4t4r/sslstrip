I've modified sslstrip to be able to tamper with server responses.

One prepared example of tampering attack is HTML5 AppCache poisoning attack that places the 
modified responses in browsers long-lasting HTML5 AppCache so that the spoofing continues
even after the victim is no longer MITMed. 

Exemplary response tampering with HTML AppCachePoison:

	1) python sslstrip.py -t app_cache_poison/config.ini

	2) While under MITM, visit http://example.com to display tampered content

	3) Visit http://www.facebook.com in AppCache supporting browser (Chrome, Firefox).
		In Firefox you have to agree to store offline content, Chrome does not display any confirmations.

	4) Stop MITM, restart browser, go for coffee or holidays

	5) Visit http://www.facebook.com again - the spoofed content is still there!
